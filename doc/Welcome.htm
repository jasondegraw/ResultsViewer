<h2>Welcome to ResultsViewer</h2>
<p>ResultsViewer is the first part of a new project called OpenStudio, which aims to develop a set of software tools to support EnergyPlus modeling. ResultsViewer displays EnergyPlus output in formats that are more useful than those available directly from the EnergyPlus engine. This application was originally developed to support the needs of researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who frequently use detailed EnergyPlus outputs to understand the intricacies of building systems. ResultsViewer displays time series results, which are produced from EnergyPlus report variable requests. ResultsViewer reads the sqlite database output of the EnergyPlus engine and presents the time series data in line and two-dimensional flood plots. It also displays the html output of EnergyPlus in an internal browser window. ResultsViewer is still an immature product. We hope to refine it further and add results viewing capabilities. You may send suggestions to <a href="mailto:openstudio@nrel.gov">openstudio@nrel.gov</a>.

<br /><h2>Quick Start</h2>
<ol>
<li>Request SQLite database output from EnergyPlus. Include one of the following lines in your idf: <br><br>

<em>Output:SQLite, Simple;</em> <br><br>
-or- <br><br>
<em>Output:SQLite, SimpleAndTabular;</em> <br><br>

<li>Choose either Simple or SimpleAndTabular. (ResultsViewer does not use tabular data.) Once you request database output, all report variable and meter requests will be output to the database. You can view these in ResultsViewer. </li>

<li>Click File-&gt;Open and browse to an eplusout.sql file in the EnergyPlus output folder. ResultsViewer is packaged with an example file you can use to explore the software’s capabilities. You do not need to run EnergyPlus</li>

<li>Examine output variables on either of two main views, table view or tree view, on the left.</li>

<li>To plot an item, right click for a context menu or double click for a line plot.</li>

<li>Drag items from each view onto a plot. In a line plot, the data will be added as an additional curve. In a flood plot, the data will be replaced with the dragged item.</li>
</ol>
      <br />
<h2>OpenStudio</h2>
<p>The purpose of the larger OpenStudio project is to provide additional tools to support EnergyPlus. The project grew from the observation that many individuals and organizations have developed software to solve specific challenges related to EnergyPlus modeling and work flow, only to have the same solution implemented later by someone else. There seems to be no central project to collect and organize these solutions so the entire community can collaborate and benefit.
We hope to address this issue on several fronts:

<ul>
<li>OpenStudio is developed using cross-platform technologies, including C++ and the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">QT framework</a>. This means that OpenStudio is written once, and then compiled and tested across many platforms, including different versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux. Thus, no specific user group, regardless of platform, is excluded. </li>
<li>OpenStudio is intended to become an open source project, which aspires to develop a strong community and enable a large group of developers to contribute to the same body of code. The project is not yet available to outside collaborators, but information and Web links will be provided as they become available. </li>
</ul>
